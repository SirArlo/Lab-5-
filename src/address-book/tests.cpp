//Exercise 4.5
//When the objects are copied it happens completely, as a result they are completely independent
//Before the temporary is constructed a check is conducted meaning that if the condition is not met then no assignment takes place
//When the shared pointer becomes an unique pointer, it is a no-fail operation
